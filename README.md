# Escape-The-Labyrinth
Part of my CS 211 Coding Practicum Final Project. A really interesting project that I really liked to play around with, but with limited capabilities because of class restraints.
This project has two main components: building a generic 2D Grid class and exploring two mazes(standard 4x4 maze; twisty maze of any shape) using gdb in the zyBooks IDE terminal to find valid escape paths. First, I implemented grid.h, which defines a templated grid structure stored as a dynamic array of dynamic arrays. Then I wrote constructors, a destructor, a copy constructor, and an assignment operator to correctly manage memory and perform deep copies. I also implemented element-access functions to retrieve or modify values at specific row/column positions. This part focuses on proper memory allocation, cleanup, and copying semantics in C++. The next major task was to implement isPathToFreedom, a function that checks whether following a string of movement directions through a maze successfully collects all three items—spellbook, wand, and potion—without ever stepping into a null pointer. The function must validate the characters in the movement string, move through the maze one step at a time, track collected items, and return true only if the explorer reaches all three.

After the implementation phase, the project turns into a debugging and exploration exercise using gdb. I ran the provided executables in the makefile to reveal the internal structure of two mazes: a regular maze that resembles a grid, and a “twisty” maze where directions don’t follow spatial logic. For each maze, I inspected the starting cell and followed its directional pointers while recording where each room leads by drawing a diagram, eventually mapping out all reachable cells in the standard 4x4 maze structure. My diagram also showed the layout of each maze(standard & twisty), the objects located inside rooms, and how the rooms are connected along with pointer memory addresses obtained though gdb. Using this diagram, I was able to determine a valid sequence of moves that collects all three required items, then record that sequence in EscapeTheLabyrinth.h. In short, the project combines dynamic memory, class design, pointer manipulation, and debugging tools to ensure you understand both low-level C++ memory management and maze traversal using pointers.
